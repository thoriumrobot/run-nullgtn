KeyValueStore
=======

A extensible reactive key value store base on RxJava2 with an extensible storage, object type, and converter API. 


Details
-------

KeyValueStore provides Mosho, Gson, and Jackson converters out of the box. 

An adaptable storage API including a multi threaded file storage implementation allow persisting data to virtually anywhere. 
Synchronized storage is currently WIP and will provide syncing between disk and network, or any other combination.
